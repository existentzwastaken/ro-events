# ro-events
"A versatile event listener, useful for scheduling events being fired and handling parameters sent to them."

Version v0.1, will probably update it.

=== I ACCEPT ANY ADVICE ON HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER ===

For now you basically put in a discord Webhook and all remote events calls will be logged based on the settings you put in the module.

The module is very basic as for now, that means that the module can have some bugs.
My idea was to have this module just to see if an exploiter is trying to fire remote events and maybe catch him while doing that.
